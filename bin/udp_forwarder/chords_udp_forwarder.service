#
# Systemd unit description for managing the CHORDS udp_forwarder as a service.
#
# Assume: The udp_forwarder service description (this file), the udp_forwarder.rb application, and
# the udp_forwarder.rb configuration (.json) are all located in /var/lib/chords/
#
# *** Note. If a security key is needed for CHORDS ingest:
#     Edit this file once you have installed it, and add the security key parameter (-s xxxx) to the
#     ExecStart command. This way you can keep the udp_forwarder configuration file (e.g. ncar_wx.json) on github,
#     without keeping a security key in it. 
#
# To install:
# Install udp_forwarder.rb
#  sudo curl -L https://github.com/earthcubeprojects-chords/chords/raw/development/bin/udp_forwarder/udp_forwarder.service > /var/lib/chords/udp_forwarder.rb
#  sudo chmod a+x /var/lib/chords/udp_forwarder.rb
#
# Fetch the service definition
#  sudo curl -L https://github.com/earthcubeprojects-chords/chords/raw/development/bin/udp_forwarder/chords_udp_forwarder.service > /var/lib/chords/udp_forwarder.service
#
# If you are making a fresh configuration, create the configuration file for for udp_forwarder.rb 
# (Don't do this if you have an existing configuration. And note that the configuration file name
#  must match what is specified in ExecStart below. Feel free to change both of these)
#  sudo curl -L https://github.com/earthcubeprojects-chords/chords/raw/development/bin/udp_forwarder/ncar_wx.json > /var/lib/chords/ncar_wx.json
#
# Enable the service. (You will get complaints about [Install] missing)
#  sudo systemctl enable /var/lib/chords/udp_forwarder.service
#
# When you make a change to a service file:
#  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
#
# To start udp_forwarder:
#  sudo systemctl start  udp_forwarder
#
# To stop udp_forwarder:
#  sudo systemctl stop    udp_forwarder
#
# To restart udp_forwarder:
#  sudo systemctl restart udp_forwarder
#
#
# Here's how to see your log files:
#  since the last boot:
#    sudo journalctl -b -u udp_forwarder.service
#  To "follow" the log messages add a -f  (like tail -f):
#    sudo journalctl -f -u udp_forwarder.service
#
